Overview: This project focuses on assessing cardiovascular health risks using clustering analysis techniques. With a dataset containing demographic information, vital signs, and heart health indicators, we aim to categorize individuals into low, moderate, and high-risk groups based on their health profiles.

Data: 'Heart Health Stats Dataset' from Kaggle

Tools: Pandas and NumPy were utilized for data preprocessing, while Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed for data visualization. Scikit-learn was utilized for clustering analysis using K-means.

Highlights: Employed K-means clustering to categorize individuals into risk groups based on their health indicators, allowing for targeted interventions and personalized healthcare approaches.
